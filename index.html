    <p> Gabe is very interested in Giraffes, but there is one simple reason why. That reason is that they can joust. There are two different ways to Giraffe joust, they are both valid ways to joust. One of the ways is just the Giraffes jousting no human interaction, this happens naturally and is a very rare site to see. While the second way, well we will say you will see this daily at Gabe's house. This second way basically involes human interaction example-Gabe. To do this you must mount the neck of the Giraffe and same with your opponent. Then grab a long stick of any kind and charge towards you opponent. Goal is the first to get nocked off their trusty stead loses. </p>
