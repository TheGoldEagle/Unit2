    <p>According to the site learn.org the average salary of a Wildlife Biologist is $63,230 a year as of May 2014. Also the top ten
    percent of Wildlife Biologists is about $96,720 a year and the lowest ten percent is about $38,080. So as you can see the pay can
    be on the lower side of jobs but, with other jobs you don't get the experience of being in the outdoors for your job. </p>
